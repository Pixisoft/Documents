**NovBundle** is a abstraction layer built on top of Asset Bundles system from
Unity Engine. This plugin focuses on simplifying the Asset Bundles workflow so
the user would not have to know too much details about the system itself.

## 🔨 How to use?

There are major three parts for you to master this package. Three parts including
`Creation`, `Upload`, `Call API`. The following instructions would help you get
through the basic usage of each parts.

### 🔍 How to create Asset Bundles?

#### 1. Create Asset Bundle

Asset Bundles are generated by platforms, hence you would have multiple folders
organized by platforms. First select a asset from the `Project` window then
create a new Asset Bundle under the `Inspector` window.

![New Asset Bundles](./etc/new_ab.png)

*P.S. Here we created a asset bundle named `_bundle_1`*

#### 2. Build Asset Bundle for target platform

Then navigate to your menu bar **NovBundle** -> **Build** -> **Target Platform**,
you should be prompt to select your output path. The following is what the
outputted result should look like.

*P.S. You can export multiple platform but make sure you have organized in platform folder*

### 🔍 Upload to server

#### 1. Upload Asset Bundles files

In order to use these files, we need to upload our exported files to a server.
You can use FTP client like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or
other alternatives to do so.

#### 2. Upload `version.txt` file

You would need to create a text file for Asset Bundles caching system. Here I
have created a text file name `version.text` with the content of `1`.

The text file content,

```
1
```

*P.S. Make sure the number should only be an unsign integer, hence should not
be number lower than 0!*

### 🔍 Download and use the Asset from the bundle

#### 1. Attach component `BundleDownloader`

Drag and drop the script `BundleDownloader` to any GameObject in the scene, so
it would start function. Make sure you fill in the variable `Bundle URL` with
your Asset Bundles url.

![Component View](./etc/comp_view.png)

*For more information, see section [Testing](#pencil-testing).*

#### 2. Access asset from script

Once you have done the above instructions, you are ready to use the asset
from your Assets Bundle. The following code is a simple example for you to use
the asset from the asset bundle you have created.

```cs
using NovBundle;

...

BundleDownloader.instance.BundleAsset(
    "_bundle_1",  // Name of the bundle
    "assets/_project/prefabs/sphere.prefab", (asset) =>  // Target asset, and callback
{
    // Instantiate the prefab to scene
    Instantiate(asset, new Vector3(10, 0, 10), Quaternion.identity);
});
```

*🎉 Done!*

## 📝 Testing

#### Methods 1. Test it on your server

For exampl,e `http://www.yourwebsite.com/example/scenes.assetbundle`

#### Methods 2. Test it with file url

For exampl,e `file://C:/example/scenes.assetbundle`
