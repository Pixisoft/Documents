### :pencil: Technical details

This plugin is base on top of [Custom Hierarchy for Unity](https://github.com/febucci/unitypackage-custom-hierarchy)
made by author [Federico](https://github.com/febucci). Thankfully, Federico
has granted us the permission to sell on to market, due to the changes we
have changed!

The source can be compiled in .NET 2.0 or above, hence all .NET version should
work well with this plugin.

This tool has been tested on Unity version 2019, but we would recommended you
use this package in Unity version 2021. We would continue support the latest
version of Unity Engine.

Notice the tool is open source; so you can find the full source code on GitHub,
the link https://github.com/Pixisoft/sHierarchy. Feel free to open issues if
you have question about the tool, or even better if you like to contribute
to the package by opening pull requests!
